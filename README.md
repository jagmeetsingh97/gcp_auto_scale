Auto-scaling helps in cloud computing by adding or removing virtual machines (VMs) based on how much they are needed. If CPU usage goes above 75%, more VMs are added to handle the extra work. When CPU usage goes down, the extra VMs are removed. This helps things run smoothly and saves money by using only the needed resources.
